## About the Project
This is another homework assignment for the UofA coding bootcamp.
I referenced an article on "How to Write Beautiful and Meaningful README.md written by Divyansh Tripathi <a href="https://silentlad.com/how-to-write-beautiful-and-meaningful-readme.md" target="_blank">(here) </a>posted under his username <a href="https://github.com/silent-lad" target="_blank">@silent-lad</a> on his website <a href="https://silentlad.com" target="_blank">silentlad.com</a>.
I found the article to be insightful and it helped me to arrange and think about a README's importance more. 

## Technologies used
JavaScript- Utilizing Node.js with npm & inquirer

## Future Scope
I would like to include an option to add a "Contributions" option to include a section stating "Contributions Welcome" and a section explaining how to contrubute, stylize the questions prompt, and improve the Markdown Only Template to have more style and options. 

## Licence
